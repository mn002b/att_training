Working downtown at the AT&T Headquarters is great, but where do you go for lunch? With so many food options and only a short amount of time allotted for lunch let’s talk about a couple of favorites. If you are looking for some quick Italian something quick and close to headquarters, Americano is a short 3 minute walk and just a 2 minute drive. Located at 1530 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201. Another great option if you are into Mexican food and Vegetarian Iron Cactus Mexican Restaurant located at 1520 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201, this is a 2 minute drive from headquarters and short 3 minute walk. On a nice day both of these places are great lunch options.
